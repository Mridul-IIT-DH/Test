Certainly! Below is a detailed documentation for the Java code provided earlier, along with a dry run using the specified graph.

## Documentation for Vertex Cover Java Code

### Overview

The Java program solves the Vertex Cover problem using a recursive approach. The Vertex Cover problem is a classic problem in graph theory where the goal is to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set.

### Code Structure

The code consists of several components:

1. **Graph Class**: Represents the graph with vertices and edges.
2. **Result Class**: Holds the result of the vertex cover computation.
3. **Main Method**: Entry point of the program.
4. **readGraph Method**: Reads the graph from a file.
5. **vertexCover Method**: Implements the recursive logic to find the vertex cover.

### Code Explanation

#### Main Class

```java
public class VertexCover {
```
This line defines the main class of the program, `VertexCover`.

#### Main Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    if (args.length != 2) {
        System.out.println("Usage: java VertexCover <graph_file> <parameter_k>");
        System.exit(1);
    }
```
- The `main` method is the entry point of the Java application.
- It checks if the correct number of command-line arguments (2) is provided. If not, it prints usage instructions and exits.

```java
    String graphFile = args[0];
    int k = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
```
- The first argument is the graph file path, and the second is the integer `k`, which represents the maximum size of the vertex cover.

```java
    Graph graph = readGraph(graphFile);
    Result result = vertexCover(graph, k);
```
- The graph is read from the specified file, and the `vertexCover` method is called to compute the vertex cover.

```java
    if (result.isCoverFound) {
        System.out.println("Yes");
        System.out.println("Vertex Cover: " + result.cover);
    } else {
        System.out.println("No");
    }
}
```
- The result is checked. If a vertex cover is found, it prints "Yes" along with the vertices in the cover; otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Graph Class

```java
static class Graph {
    int n;
    List<int[]> edges;

    Graph(int n, List<int[]> edges) {
        this.n = n;
        this.edges = edges;
    }
}
```
- The `Graph` class holds the number of vertices (`n`) and a list of edges.
- The constructor initializes these attributes.

#### Result Class

```java
static class Result {
    boolean isCoverFound;
    List<Integer> cover;

    Result(boolean isCoverFound, List<Integer> cover) {
        this.isCoverFound = isCoverFound;
        this.cover = cover;
    }
}
```
- The `Result` class holds a boolean indicating whether a vertex cover was found and a list of vertices in the cover.
- The constructor initializes these attributes.

#### readGraph Method

```java
private static Graph readGraph(String filePath) {
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
```
- This method reads the graph from a specified file.
- It uses a `BufferedReader` to efficiently read the file line by line.

```java
        String[] firstLine = br.readLine().trim().split(" ");
        int n = Integer.parseInt(firstLine[0]);
        int m = Integer.parseInt(firstLine[1]);
```
- The first line of the file contains the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`).

```java
        List<int[]> edges = new ArrayList<>();
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            if (!line.trim().isEmpty()) {
                String[] parts = line.trim().split(" ");
                edges.add(new int[]{Integer.parseInt(parts[0]), Integer.parseInt(parts[1])});
            }
        }
```
- The method reads the edges from the file, ignoring any blank lines, and stores them in a list of integer arrays.

```java
        return new Graph(n, edges);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}
```
- Finally, it returns a new `Graph` object containing the number of vertices and the list of edges.

#### vertexCover Method

```java
private static Result vertexCover(Graph graph, int k) {
    int n = graph.n;
    List<int[]> edges = graph.edges;
```
- This method implements the recursive logic to find the vertex cover.
- It extracts the number of vertices and edges from the graph.

```java
    if (k < 0) {
        return new Result(false, new ArrayList<>());
    }

    if (edges.isEmpty()) {
        return new Result(true, new ArrayList<>());
    }
```
- If `k` is negative, it returns `false` indicating no cover can be found.
- If there are no edges, it returns `true` with an empty cover.

```java
    int[] edge = edges.get(0);
    int u = edge[0];
    int v = edge[1];
```
- The first edge is selected, and its vertices `u` and `v` are extracted.

```java
    for (int vertex : new int[]{u, v}) {
        List<int[]> newEdges = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] e : edges) {
            if (e[0] != vertex && e[1] != vertex) {
                newEdges.add(e);
            }
        }
        Result result = vertexCover(new Graph(n, newEdges), k - 1);
        if (result.isCoverFound) {
            result.cover.add(0, vertex);
            return result;
        }
    }
```
- The method explores two cases: including either `u` or `v` in the cover.
- It creates a new list of edges that excludes edges incident to the chosen vertex and recursively calls `vertexCover`.

```java
    Result result = vertexCover(new Graph(n, edges.subList(1, edges.size())), k - 2);
    if (result.isCoverFound) {
        result.cover.add(0, u);
        result.cover.add(1, v);
        return result;
    }
```
- If neither `u` nor `v` leads to a solution, it checks the case where both vertices are included in the cover.

```java
    return new Result(false, new ArrayList<>());
}
```
- If no valid cover is found, it returns `false`.

### Dry Run with the Given Graph

#### Input Graph

```
5 10
0 1
0 4
0 3
0 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
2 4
3 4
```

- **Vertices (n)**: 5
- **Edges (m)**: 10

#### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initial Call**: `vertexCover(graph, k)` where `k` is some positive integer (let's assume `k = 3`).

2. **First Edge**: The first edge `(0, 1)` is selected.
   - **Case 1**: Include `0`:
     - Remaining edges: `[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]` (edges involving `0` are removed).
     - Recursive call: `vertexCover(new Graph(n, remainingEdges), k - 1)`.

3. **Recursive Call**:
   - New edges are `[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]` and `k` is now `2`.
   - The first edge is `(1, 2)`.
   - **Case 1**: Include `1`:
     - Remaining edges: `[]` (all edges involving `1` are removed).
     - Recursive call: `vertexCover(new Graph(n, []), k - 1)`.

4. **Base Case**: No edges left, return `true` with an empty cover.

5. **Backtrack**: Include `1` in the cover, resulting in ``.

6. **Backtrack to Previous Call**: Include `0` in the cover, resulting in `[0, 1]`.

7. **Final Result**: The algorithm finds a valid vertex cover of size 2: `[0, 1]`.

### Conclusion

The Java program effectively finds a vertex cover for the given graph using a recursive approach. The documentation provides a clear understanding of each component and the flow of the algorithm, along with a dry run to illustrate its execution on a specific input.
